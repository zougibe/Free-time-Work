Dear Attempter, Following the reviewerâ€™s instructions: 1. The original code runs correctly. 2. The original image is consistent with the original code. 3. The revised code runs correctly and the design has been improved. In this iteration, important visual and functional enhancements were implemented, such as the integration of Font Awesome, the addition of animations and hover effects to improve user experience, and the Optimal Trading Strategy functionality was made dynamic, recalculating results in real time based on user input. These improvements not only enrich interaction but also increase the clarity and usefulness of the analysis. 4. The revised image is consistent with the resulting code. 5. The revised response, although partially edited, now includes all mentioned additions, accurately reflecting the changes made. 6. The justification has also been improved, taking into account the added elements and aligning with the requirements of the task. With these enhancements, the work shows notable progress in both technical quality and user experience. Keep up the great work!
